*Overview*:

The first dataset is a survey of men and women in African, Asian, and South American countries, exploring the attitudes and perceived justifications given for committing acts of violence against women. The second dataset is The World Happiness Report which is a landmark survey of the state of global happiness that ranks 156 countries by how happy their citizens perceive themselves to be.


*Hypothesis*:

Hypothesis 1: The responses of people who are married and living together have more values for justifying these violences against women then never married and divorced or widowed.

Hypothesis 2: The happiness(ladder score) of the countries with low average value of justifying violence against women for any specific reason should be high assuming they are social forward then the other countries and believe any of the reasons for commiting violence is less/not justified.
